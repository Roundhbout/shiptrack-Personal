# shiptrack-Personal

This is a personal copy of shiptrack for Zach's personal github. Shiptrack was a project for IS4300, Human Computer Interaction. For the final project we were tasked with prototyping, testing, and implementing a gui to solve some problem. The final implementation was done in python with PyQt5 and Qt Designer, and can be run through a .exe file in the dist folder (The executable was created with pyinstaller).

The implementation is rough and not genuinely functional, as the the design, testing, iteration, and implementation of the gui was the key focus of the class and project, so there's very little back end on the project since it wasn't the point of the class. The project idea was to be a web app, but since nobody in the group had web app experience, we decided to create a python application that mocked a web app gui.
